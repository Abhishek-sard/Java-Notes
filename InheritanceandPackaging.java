//1.inheritance -  the procedure or mechanism of acquiring all the properties and behavior of one class to another.

//2.extend keyword - keywoard used to inherit the properties of a class.
//types of inheritances
    //1.single inheritances - a single class gets derived from its base class.ex
    //2.multi-level inheritance-  a derived class gets created from another derived class and can have any number of levels.
    //3.Hierarchical inheritance- two or more classes inherit the properties of one existing class.

//3.why multiple inheritance is not supported in java? ans: To reduce the complexity and simplify the language, multiple inheritance is not supported in java.

//4. 'SUPER' keywoard in java is a reference variable that is used to refer parent class object.

//5.METHOD OVERRIDING - The process of redefining the inherited method of the super class in the derived class is called method overriding.

//6. COMPILE TIME POLYMORPHISM -

//7. RUN TIME POLYMORPHISM- 

//8. 'ABSTRACT' - is a keyword used to create a class as an abstract class and it can contain abstract method.
                    //eg.
                    public abstract class A{
                        ............
                        public abstract void myMethod();
                        void myMethod(){

                        }
                    }
                    
//9. INTERFACE - blueprint of a class or referecnce type 

//10. Final  class-

//11. Abstract class-

//12. PACKAGE - is a mechanism to encapsulate a group of classes, interfaces and sub packages which is used to providing access protection and namespace management and to make searching/locating and using of classes, interfacess, enumerations and annotations easier.
