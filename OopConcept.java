//OOP - object oriented 
// object = data + method
//object- any entity that has state and behavior is known as an object.
//Component of class 
//method overloading - if we defined many method with same name but with diffrent in parameters then this process is called method overloading.
//constructors - three rules.
  //1. constructor name must be same as its class name.
  //2. constructor do not have a return type
  //3. constructor are invoked using the new operator when an object is created.

//default constructor- a constructor that has no parameter is known as default constructor.
//parameterized construtor - a constructor that has  parameter is known as parameterized constructor.
//constructor overloading-
//copy constructor-
//'this' - this keyword refers to the current object in a method or constructor.
//static keywoard- static keyword is used for memory management.
   //variable-if we declare any variable as static known as static variable.
   //method - if we apply static keyword with any method known as static method.
   //block - used for static initialization of class.
   //nested class  -  

// Recursion - is a  process by which a a function calls itself repeatedly until some specified condition has been satisfied.
